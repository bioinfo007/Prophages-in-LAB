# Prophages-in-LAB
# Prophage Comparison, Extraction, and Classification

This repository provides a reproducible pipeline to **compare prophage predictions**, **extract integrated prophage regions**, and **classify prophages** from bacterial genomes.  
The workflow is designed for large-scale comparative genomics studies, particularly for **lactic acid bacteria (LAB)**, but can be adapted for any bacterial dataset, provided the format of input prophage prediction data is compatible.

---

## Overview of the Workflow

The pipeline consists of **three main steps**:

1. **Compare prophage predictions** generated by PhiSpy and Phigaro  
2. **Extract consensus prophage regions** from genome assemblies  
3. **Classify prophages** based on gene content and structural features obtained after running PHAROKA

## Input data files containing the prophage predictions by Phigaro and Phispy
1. **Genome accessions:** Assembly_accessions.txt
2. **Phigaro prediction:** phigaro.tsv
3. **Phispy prediction:** phispy.tsv
## Genomes used in this study are available from NCBI and can be downloaded using the NCBI Datasets command-line interface (CLI), and Assembly_accessions.txt file
